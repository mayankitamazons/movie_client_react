Project By Mayank Upadhyay For Lead Module Role
Thanks for giving me chance to do Assignment, Completed Both Assignment
1)   Assignment 1
- Front end repo - https://github.com/mayankitamazons/movie_client_react
•	I used React.js with Material UI for the front-end.
•	To improve your code, consider splitting it into multiple components and maintaining proper routes related to the home page. Additionally, it's important to create a "not found" page. To keep your code organized, keep configuration files and API calls separate.
•	For now, I only fetched and listed movie data for reference purposes. Later on, we can also use hooks to create infinite page scrolling with a certain limit of data on a single page.


- Backend Repo - https://github.com/mayankitamazons/movie_client_react
•	I used Node.js,mongodb with Express to create a common model and functionality. 
•	Later on, if we want to add a new model, we can simply add the respective data and continue. 
•	To make it more secure, we can add JWT authentication and validators to validate the model as well.

 
2)  Assignment    2
Server Repo - https://github.com/mayankitamazons/task2_server
•  I used Node.js and MongoDB with Express to create a common model and functionality.
I also used the validator-express rule inline with the controller. Later on, we can move them to a separate folder if required.
